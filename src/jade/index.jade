                Gait Kinematics
            .text.
                As the movement of the person walking is recorded by high speed video cameras a re-<br>
                constructive digital model is created in order to calculate joint motion in each plane.

                Gait Kinetics
            .text.
                Kinetics are the forces which act across the joints.<br>
                The ground reaction force of each foot strike is measured as the person walks through<br>
                the force plate. The magnitude of the ground reaction forces can then be calculated<br>
                during different phases of the gait cycle.

                Surface Electromyography
            .text.
                SEMG provides information about how the myscles work during walking. We can use the<br>
                SEMG data to see how each muscle acts and how it contributes to the gait abnormality.

                Foot Pressure
            .text.
                Foot pressure is measured during walking through a specialized instrumented treadmill.<br>
                This enables a visualization of foot mechanics, timing sequence of gait cycles, 3-D pres-<br>
                sure distribution and a visualization of center of pressure (gait line).

                How Is Gait Analysis Preformed?
            .text.
                The subject walks on the specialized walkway or instrumented treadmill. The markers are<br>
                tracking motion by multi camera motion capture system. Force plates in the walk-<br>
                way/treadmill gather kineatic data as the subject walks over them. A computer worksta-<br>
                tion equipped with motion analysis software permits the gait data to be analyzed. After<br>
                processing the gait analysis, report including video clips of your gait cycles is produced.<br>

                Who Needs Gait Analysis?
            .text.
                Gait analysis is extremely diagnostic for patients with lower extremity problems, patients<br>
                who have pain during walking or running. People with knee, hip, foot and ankle pain.<br>
                Athletes and runners.As well as people who have balance and instability issues during<br>
                walking. Some categories of low back pain patients could also benefit from gait analysis.
